    heroDescription: "I extract clarity from complexity. From deep SQL analysis to real-time dashboards, I help teams make better decisions by turning messy data into clear, actionable insights.",

I spend my time building analytical frameworks and automated reporting systems that handle the heavy lifting, so people can focus on strategy rather than cleaning spreadsheets. Whether it's a complex SQL deep-dive or a sleek Looker dashboard, my goal is always the same: make it accurate, make it fast, and make it insightful.",
